Notes:
	HomePage.cshtml and Login.cshtml has conflicting purpose
	Give Account.cshtml a proper homepage. Give the tables their own pages to reduce the need to keep loading data from database when it is not needed.
	Does every view/page need to be located in the same directory?
Changes:
	Switched .net version from .net 6.0 to .net 7.0.
	Added Add Employee button to Account.cshtml
	Modified HomePage.cshtml, AddProduct.cshtml, AddEmployee.cshtml to use Html Helpers
Additions:
